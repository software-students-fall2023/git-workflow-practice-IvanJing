<h2>New Javascript all-in-one toolkit released called BUN </h2>

<h3>Article link: https://thenewstack.io/bun-1-0-ships-as-node-js-and-deno-alternative/</h3>


<p>Though I've not kept up to track with Javascript developments, I've heard a significant amount of discussion around the newly released toolkit, Bun. The article linked above is just a simple piece discussing its release and some commentary behind its development, so it serves as a decent introduction to the toolkit. The key detail about Bun is that it serves as a speedier *replacement* for the wildly important *Node.js*, a popular environment already known for its speed.

<p>What I find most important about the release of Bun is its potential. Though Bun is built for speed, it likely isn't as fast it claims to be. However, the improvements it has made towards simplifying the nightmarish Javascript toolchain is impressive. Unlike previous environments like Deno, Bun is a drop-in replacement, meaning transitioning to Bun is far simpler. This could mean that further discoveries and improvements to Bun are more likely in the future, or it could spell an end to Bun's hypetrain. Either way, the ultimate effects of Bun's release will only truly be felt several years down the line, and I'm positive that it'll have made some imapct to me and anyone else looking to work with Javascript moving forward.</p>

I also haven't been to up to date with Javascript development but from what I'm reading, I think Bun is a great competitor for Node and Deno. 
Bun boasts much faster runtime than Node and Deno, which could make Node and Deno consider making their runtimes quicker as well. This is great 
for developers as they will have more options to choose from which can make these technologies co-exist with one another rather than replacing one 
another.
